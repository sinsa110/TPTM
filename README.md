* The original paper is as follow: [***Crowdsourced Time-sync Video Tagging using Temporal and Personalized Topic Modeling***](https://research.yahoo.com/_c/uploads/frp0203-wuA.pdf)
* The derivation of the formula in paper and the implement of this package is trivial.It was based on LDA model,the final result of this model works not very well in my experiment.
